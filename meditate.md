# Learn to Meditate

## 0-2m My experience

* Estimate that I've done about 450 hours of practice (30m/day, 6 days/week, 50 weeks/year = 150 hours)

## 2-5m Your experience

* How much meditating have you done?
* Interested to hear what you think meditation is and how you do it
* Why do you want to learn?

## 5-8m Why meditate?

* Buddhism: nirvāṇa; happiness independent of conditions (Shinzen Young)
* (Mindfulness) meditation as focused attention
  * Mind wandering as the opposite of mindfulness
  * People consistently less happy when mind wandering, regardless of valence of thoughts.  Evidence that MW causes unhappiness (Killingsworth & Gilbert, 2010)

## 8-10m 2m meditation

* Easy to define

1. Sit relaxed, but upright and alert
1. Attend to any sensation associated with your breathing
1. When you notice you’ve stopped doing step 2, let go of what your were attending to and return to step 2
